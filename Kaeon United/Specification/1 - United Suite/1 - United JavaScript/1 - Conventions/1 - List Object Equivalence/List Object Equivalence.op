List Object Equivalence

	Philosophy

		-
			List object equivalence is a JavaScript convention that allows any object to be
			interpreted as a list by taking the values of every field and ordering them in the
			order of their respective keys, and allows any list to be interpreted as an object by
			making each element a field value with the keys of said field being the respective
			indicies.
