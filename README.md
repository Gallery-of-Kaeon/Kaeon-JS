<h2 align="center">What is Kaeon United?</h2>

Kaeon United is JavaScript framework designed to meet the following goals:

* To allow the use of CommonJS in the browser,
even when module paths are dynamic,
without any precompilation required.

* To allow an entire application to be developed without HTML or CSS,
where a single JavaScript file serves as the main file,
where JavaScript dependencies are handled by CommonJS,
and the entire frontend of the application is managed through the DOM.

* To provide a JavaScript based [Kaeon FUSION](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/blob/master/README.md) interpreter,
to provide the option for a Kaeon FUSION to be used in place of JavaScript,
and to provide JavaScript implementations of Kaeon FUSION's most essential utilities,
including and especially the standard interface.

* To establish a standard for writing CommonJS utilities that provided the same interface for modules that require different implementations between the browser and Node.js.

* To provide various other miscellaneous JavaScript utilities for convenience.
