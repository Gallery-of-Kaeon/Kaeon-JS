<h2 align="center">What is Kaeon United?</h2>

Kaeon United is an HTML and JavaScript application framework designed to meet the following goals:

* To allow the use of the node.js require function in the browser,
even when the path is dynamic.

* To allow an entire application to be developed without HTML or CSS,
where a single JavaScript file serves as the main file,
JavaScript dependencies are handled by the require function,
and the entire frontend of the application is managed through the DOM.

* To provide a wrapper module that allows the same code to be used on the browser or on node.js for common tasks such as opening files or retrieving console input.

* To provide a JavaScript based [Kaeon FUSION](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/blob/master/README.md) interpreter,
and to provide the option for a Kaeon FUSION file to act as the main file in place of a JavaScript file.

<h2 align="center">How to Use</h2>

To begin, download the [bundle](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-United/raw/master/Kaeon%20United/Bundle/Kaeon%20United.zip).
Then,
unzip said bundle into the desired directory.
For a Javascript project,
simply replace the code in the index.js file with the desired Javascript.
For a Kaeon FUSION project,
uncomment the comment block starting at line 5 in the index.js file and replace the code in the index.op file with the desired Kaeon FUSION.

<h2 align="center">Porting</h2>

It is recommended that [electron](https://electronjs.org/) be used for porting Kaeon United apps to desktop apps and that [cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) be used for porting Kaeon United apps to mobile apps.
